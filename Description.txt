Hello, it's Jad Mattar. This is a description file of the project.

In this file, we are going to send and receive data via WiFi.

Three experiments are done at once: controlling light, controlling servo motor and reading LDR sensor values.

We have used ESP32 controller. We controlled the built-in led at pin 2 and connected the servo motor to pin 18 and the LDR to pin 34.
We set the WiFi mode to station and connected to WiFi and tested. The LED can turn ON and OFF. The servo motor can rotate between 0 and 180 degrees. The LDR values are printed on the webpage each 5 seconds and are saved in JSON file.
